# Dependency

A data structure for representing dependency graphs in Clojure.

This library provides a basic implementation of a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) data structure, represented as a pair of maps. It is
immutable and persistent.

Nodes in the graph may be any type which supports Clojure's equality
semantics such as keywords, symbols, or strings.

I originally developed this library to support namespace dependency
tracking in [tools.namespace], where it is still included under the
name `clojure.tools.namespace.dependency`.

I am releasing this library independently so that other projects can
use it without adding a dependency on all of tools.namespace.

## Releases and Dependency Information

This library is released on [Clojars]. Latest release is 0.2.1

[Leiningen] dependency information:

    [weavejester/dependency "0.2.1"]

[Clojars]: http://clojars.org/
[Leiningen]: http://leiningen.org/


## Version Compatibility

Version 0.2.0 requires Clojure 1.7.0 or higher for
Conditional Read (`.cljc`) support.

Version 0.2.0 also supports ClojureScript versions with
Conditional Read.

Version 0.1.1 of this library remains compatible with
Clojure versions 1.3.0, 1.4.0, and 1.5.1.


## Usage

    (require '[weavejester.dependency :as dep])

Create a new dependency graph:

    (def g1 (-> (dep/graph)
                (dep/depend :b :a)   ; "B depends on A"
                (dep/depend :c :b)   ; "C depends on B"
                (dep/depend :c :a)   ; "C depends on A"
                (dep/depend :d :c))) ; "D depends on C"

This creates a structure like the following:

         :a
        / |
      :b  |
        \ |
         :c
          |
         :d

Ask questions of the graph:

    (dep/transitive-dependencies g1 :d)
    ;;=> #{:a :c :b}

    (dep/depends? g1 :d :b)
    ;;=> true

Get a topological sort:

    (dep/topo-sort g1)
    ;;=> (:a :b :c :d)

Refer to the docstrings for more API documentation. Refer to the tests
for more examples.


## Development and Contributing

This library is a repackaging of `clojure.tools.namespace.dependency`.
All changes must go through [tools.namespace] and the Clojure
[contributing] process.
